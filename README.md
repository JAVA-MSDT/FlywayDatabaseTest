# FlywayDatabaseTest

Testing Database using Flyway migration library.

Testing your data base without touching Your original data by using an in-memory Database such as Embedded PostgreSQL,

also using flyway to migrate the SQL  script to the databases, 

by this way you are guaranteeing the integrity of your data inside your production or your main database, 

that is because all of your tests are going to be in-memory database.


In this video I am explaining the concept of using the in-memory database to test your Data Access Object DAO,

I have explained according to my current experience and knowledge, hope it will be benefits for you.
